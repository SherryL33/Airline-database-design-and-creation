### Project Overview
SkyHigh Airways is a commercial airline that operates domestic and international flights. The airline serves a wide variety of passengers and offers multiple flight classes, including economy, business, and first class. SkyHigh Airways aims to provide an efficient and comfortable travel experience, supported by a team of dedicated crew members, airport staff, and a customer service team. To streamline operations and manage customer interactions, the airline needs a comprehensive database to track flights, reservations, aircraft, and other key aspects of its business.

### Tools Used
- The DBMS used is MariaDB Server.
- The user interface used is HeidiSQL.
- Used Draw.io for the ER diagram model.

### User Requirements 
The requirement-gathering process was conducted with SkyHigh Airways staff to determine their expectations from the database. The airline operations manager started by explaining the operating environment of SkyHigh Airways as follows:
1. Each passenger is assigned a unique passenger ID and may have multiple reservations across different flights.
2. Reservations are made through the airline's reservation system and are identified by a unique reservation ID, with statuses such as confirmed, pending, or canceled.
3. A reservation belongs to a single passenger but can include one or more flights within the passengerâ€™s itinerary.
4. The airline owns a fleet of aircraft, each with a unique aircraft ID, model, seating capacity, and maintenance schedule.
5. Each flight is assigned a single aircraft, while an aircraft may operate multiple flights over time.
6. Crew members, identified by a unique employee ID, are assigned to flights based on their roles, and each flight has multiple crew members assigned.
7. Each reservation generates a ticket with a unique ticket number, specifying the flight class and fare. A ticket is associated with only one passenger and one reservation.
8. The airline offers a frequent flyer program, where each frequent flyer account has a unique account ID, a status level (silver, gold, platinum), and accumulated miles.
9. A passenger may have a frequent flyer account, but each frequent flyer account is linked to only one passenger.

#### Major Reports Required:
##### Daily Flight Operations Report:
At the end of each day, airline staff must submit a report detailing all completed flights, including flight numbers, departure and arrival times, assigned aircraft, and the names and IDs of assigned crew members.

##### Monthly Passenger Reservation Report:
A comprehensive report is generated at the end of each month, summarizing all passenger reservations, including reservation IDs, booking statuses, and the number of flights per reservation.

##### Yearly Frequent Flyer Summary:
An annual report is compiled at the end of the year, providing an overview of frequent flyer members, including their account IDs, status levels, and total miles accumulated or redeemed.

##### Aircraft Maintenance Schedule:
Aircraft are systematically monitored based on their maintenance schedules, ensuring that each aircraft undergoes inspections and servicing at the designated intervals.
